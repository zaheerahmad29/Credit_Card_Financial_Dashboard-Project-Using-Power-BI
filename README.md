Most revenue comes from people aged 20â€“50 years old, especially from the 20â€“30 age group.â€‹

Female customers generate slightly more revenue than male customers.â€‹

Customers with high incomes and graduates spend the most using credit cards.â€‹

The states that bring in the most credit card revenue are Texas, New York, California, Florida, and New Jersey.â€‹

Business owners and self-employed people contribute the most revenue, while retirees and blue-collar workers contribute the least.â€‹

Married and single customers both spend heavily, but those with more dependents tend to spend more.â€‹

# Credit Card Transaction Dashboard
There were 657,000 transactions totaling 45 million in amount.â€‹

Quarterly revenue is steady at around 14 million each quarter.â€‹

Most spending happens on bills, followed by entertainment, fuel, groceries, and food.â€‹

Blue cardholders contribute the most revenue by card type, far more than gold, silver, or platinum.â€‹

The swipe method is the most popular for transactions, beating out chip and online usage.â€‹

Graduates and high school-educated customers make the most transactions.â€‹

Customer acquisition cost is highest for blue cardholders and much lower for premium cards.â€‹
